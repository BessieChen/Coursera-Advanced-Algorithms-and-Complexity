# Coursera-Advanced-Algorithms-and-Complexity
This course talks about networks flows which are used in more obvious applications such as optimal matchings, finding disjoint paths and flight scheduling as well as more surprising ones like image segmentation in computer vision. 

It then proceed to linear programming with applications in optimizing budget allocation, portfolio optimization, finding the cheapest diet satisfying all requirements, call routing in telecommunications and many others. 

Next discussing inherently hard problems for which no exact good solutions are known (and not likely to be found) and how to solve them in practice.
